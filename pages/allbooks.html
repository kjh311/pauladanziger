                                A modern classic with issues that will be relevant always. Marcy Lewis is bored by school, she knows she's never going to be thin, and she is dead sure she'll never have a date. Life at home isn't great either, since her father bosses her and her mother around. Then along comes Ms. Finney, an English teacher who'll try anything in the classroom and actually treats kids like human beings. Now that she's found a teacher who sees Marcy as more than a name on an attendance sheet, Marcy realizes her life could mean something. When Ms. Finney is suspended, Marcy knows she's got to take a stand. But is this new independence worth the price she'll pay at school and at home?</p>

Finally, she’s on her own for the first time, away from family and school. It’s her big chance to reinvent herself. Marcy’s sure everything will be perfect—until the campers arrive. Being surrounded by nosy, giggling, joke-telling girls (and one nightmare camper in particular) is enough to make her want to jump in a lake. Her only solace is her nights out with Ted, a sweet, guitar-playing boys’ counselor. But is Marcy ready for that? Can she handle a potential boyfriend and the demands of twelve campers for an entire summer? And are there really bats in the ceiling of the dining hall?</p>

It means leaving her New York City apartment and friends, moving to the country with her dad, and tak­ing the bus every weekend to visit her mom in the city. It means she has to go to ninth grade in a new school and see her father go on dates. It’s a hectic life with no time to feel she really belongs with the kids in either place. Then, just when Phoebe gets a handle on juggling the pieces of her life, her mother makes a decision that will change everything again. How can Phoebe be herself and still be part of both her parents’ worlds?</p>

Now Rosie’s mom and Phoebe’s dad have fallen in love, and they’re all mov­ing in together. Rosie has always dreamed of having a “real” family, but having Phoebe as a sister and having Phoebe as a best friend are two very different things. And having an extra parent around isn’t easy for anyone to get used to. It seemed like the perfect set­up, but can their friendship sur­vive in the same house?

And they've planned a goofy scavenger hunt for the kids, including Kendra's bratty younger brother. They have to race all around New York City and visit places like the Empire State Building and the United Nations to find answers. But once they get started, Kendra doesn't mind the scavenger hunt so much, mostly because Frank turns out to be just as interesting as all of the sights.</p>
