                                A modern classic with issues that will be relevant always. Marcy Lewis is bored by school, she knows she's never going to be thin, and she is dead sure she'll never have a date. Life at home isn't great either, since her father bosses her and her mother around. Then along comes Ms. Finney, an English teacher who'll try anything in the classroom and actually treats kids like human beings. Now that she's found a teacher who sees Marcy as more than a name on an attendance sheet, Marcy realizes her life could mean something. When Ms. Finney is suspended, Marcy knows she's got to take a stand. But is this new independence worth the price she'll pay at school and at home?</p>

                                Marcy Lewis is thrilled when her former teacher Ms. Finney asks her to be a junior counselor at a creative arts camp. Finally, she’s on her own for the first time, away from family and school. It’s her big chance to reinvent herself. Marcy’s sure everything will be perfect—until the campers arrive. Being surrounded by nosy, giggling, joke-telling girls (and one nightmare camper in particular) is enough to make her want to jump in a lake. Her only solace is her nights out with Ted, a sweet, guitar-playing boys’ counselor. But is Marcy ready for that? Can she handle a potential boyfriend and the demands of twelve campers for an entire summer? And are there really bats in the ceiling of the dining hall?</p>

It means leaving her New York City apartment and friends, moving to the country with her dad, and tak­ing the bus every weekend to visit her mom in the city. It means she has to go to ninth grade in a new school and see her father go on dates. It’s a hectic life with no time to feel she really belongs with the kids in either place. Then, just when Phoebe gets a handle on juggling the pieces of her life, her mother makes a decision that will change everything again. How can Phoebe be herself and still be part of both her parents’ worlds?</p>

                                What could be better? Rosie and Phoebe have been best friends since they met on the Divorce Express, shuttling between their parents on weekends. Now Rosie’s mom and Phoebe’s dad have fallen in love, and they’re all mov­ing in together. Rosie has always dreamed of having a “real” family, but having Phoebe as a sister and having Phoebe as a best friend are two very different things. And having an extra parent around isn’t easy for anyone to get used to. It seemed like the perfect set­up, but can their friendship sur­vive in the same house?

And they've planned a goofy scavenger hunt for the kids, including Kendra's bratty younger brother. They have to race all around New York City and visit places like the Empire State Building and the United Nations to find answers. But once they get started, Kendra doesn't mind the scavenger hunt so much, mostly because Frank turns out to be just as interesting as all of the sights.</p>

                                Matthew Martin finds himself on the threshold of becoming a teenager in suburban America and experiences conflicting emotions regarding his future. Completing sixth grade, Matthew notices that ``everything is getting so complicated...everything around him is changing'': older sister Amanda is hostile and rebellious; his parents appear publicly in weird costumes for his mother's message-delivery service. Here, although Matthew's thoughts are still as funny as they were in Everyone Else's Parents Said Yes (1989), his comments and actions are more restrained. He battles with Amanda and classmate Vanessa, but he notices a change in his feelings about girls; he goes on his first date with Jil, but then, during a class trip, peer pressure causes them to quarrel as they struggle to maintain a balance between time together and with others. As sixth grade ends, Matthew ``can't wait to see where [Spaceship Earth] takes him next.</p>

This third Matthew story stands alone, but will have readers asking for the others." </i> -Kirkus Reviews</p>

                                Amber Brown and Justin Daniels are best friends. They've known each other for practically forever, sit next to each other in class, help each other with homework, and always stick up for each other. Justin never says things like, "Amber Brown is not a crayon." Amber never says, "Justin Time." They're a great team—until disaster strikes. Justin has to move away, and now the best friends are fighting. Will they be able to work it out before it's too late? Along with the ups and downs of shared custody, the Amber Brown chapter books are beloved for tackling relatable dilemmas with thoughtfulness, humor, and plenty of puns.</p>

                            <p> Amber Brown and Justin Daniels are best friends. They've known each other for practically forever, sit next to each other in class, help each other with homework, and always stick up for each other. Justin never says things like, "Amber Brown is...</p>

                               Only Amber Brown can handle going to a new grade without her best friend with such honesty, humor, and heart. 
                               Amber Brown isn't entirely ready for fourth grade. She has her pens, pencils, new clothes, and new shoes. But the one thing she doesn't have is her best friend, Justin Daniels. Justin has moved away, leaving Amber utterly best friend-less. Amber knows Justin can't be replaced, but she is on the lookout for a new friend. Brandi seems a likely choice, but does Brandi want to choose Amber in return? Will Amber Brown go fourth, and go forth, with a new best friend?
							   Along with the ups and downs of shared custody, the Amber Brown chapter books are beloved for tackling relatable dilemmas with thoughtfulness, humor, and plenty of puns.</p>

Then she had to deal with her parents' divorce and her dad's move to France. She?s even getting used to her mom's boyfriend, Max. Now the only change that she wants is to redo her bedroom. But then Max asks Amber's mom to marry him. If she says yes, they might have to move. But if she says no, then Max may leave. Amber's mom is confused, and so is Amber! Can't things just stay the same for once?

                               Amber Brown has a big decision to make: spend Thanksgiving with Mom in Walla Walla, Washington, or with Dad in New York. Amber doesn't want to choose, but the grown-ups are leaving it up to her. Things only get worse when she goes to school and meets the new girl Kelly Green. No one in the class has ever had a two-color name like Amber Brown. Home. School. Nothing is going right! Amber Brown is most definitely feeling blue.

                               Amber Brown loves the holidays. But this year, the season is bringing big changes. Amber's dad has moved back to New Jersey, which means shared custody. Soon Amber feels as if half of her belongs to her mom and half of her belongs to her dad. Amber decides that she needs to claim something for herself, and when the topic of ear-piercing comes up, she knows just what she's going to do! After all, don't her ears belong to her? Full of all the fun, humor, and realistic dialogue that Paula Danziger's famous for, this is a winning entry in the ever-popular series.

                               Amber's parents just aren't acting the way she thinks parents should. Sometimes her dad goes out on dates when he is supposed to be spending time with her. And her Mom went to Disneyland with Aunt Pam while Amber was with her dad (not fair!). Then Mom and Max decide to get married even sooner and move to a new house—maybe even a new town. Some kids seem to have no problems...and that makes Amber Brown green with envy.

                               Beloved Amber Brown returns in a new book!  Amber Brown is excited about her mom and Max’s upcoming wedding. Not only does Amber get to be the Best Child but all her best friends are invited, including Justin, whose family will be making a special trip back to town just for the big event! But when every conversation about the wedding causes a fight about money, they talk about a having a tiny wedding without any family or friends. On top of that she’s on the hunt for the perfect dress and writing her Best Child speech.  Paula Danziger called Bruce Coville and Elizabeth Levy her best friend and her other best friend, and this close connection enabled them to lovingly capture Amber Brown's voice, sense of humor, big-heartedness, and her fondness for puns.

Now that Amber’s mom and Max are married, the three of them are moving to a new house and Amber is worried about more than just packing. How can she leave the home her dad used to live in? And with her dad dating again, how will they ever find time for just the two of them? All of these changes make Amber's head spin, but with standardized tests coming up at school as well as a dance competition, she needs to focus more than ever. If Amber wants to adjust to her new life and survive the school year, she'd better get moving!

                               I, Amber Brown, have boxes to fill. Now that Amber’s mom and Max are married, the three of them are moving to a new house and Amber is worried about more than just packing. How can she leave the home her dad used to live in? And with her dad dating again, how will they ever find time for just the two of them? All of these changes make Amber's head spin, but with standardized tests coming up at school as well as a dance competition, she needs to focus more than ever. If Amber wants to adjust to her new life and survive the school year, she'd better get moving!

And a perfect day at the fair turns into just a fair day.

It's so perfect that she's keeping it a secret even from her best friend, Justin, no matter what he bribes her with. Amber can't wait to reveal the surprise and go trick-or-treating, but she's worried that her parents' arguing will put a damper on the holiday. But with pumpkin decorating, Halloween jokes, candy treats, and the greatest costume ever, this is going to be the perfect Halloween!
